/*

A Sinon spy is a function that records arguments, return value, the value of this, and exceptions thrown (if any) for all its calls. This allows you to inspect how a function was used during testing.



Spies are useful for:

Checking if a function was called.
Verifying the number of times a function was called.
Inspecting the arguments passed to a function.
Ensuring a function behaves correctly under various conditions.
