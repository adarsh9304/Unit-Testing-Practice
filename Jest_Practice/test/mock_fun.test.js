Unit Tests with Mocks: In logger.test.js, you verify that your code handles different scenarios without making actual API calls. This keeps the tests fast and reliable.
Integration Test without Mocks: In userService.test.js, you test the actual API endpoint to ensure it returns the expected data. This test confirms that the API itself is functioning as expected.
Why Do Both?
Unit Tests: Help you ensure that your code works correctly in isolation. You can test various edge cases, like handling errors, without relying on the API.
Integration Tests: Confirm that your code works correctly with real-world external systems, like the third-party API. This ensures that your code can correctly interact with the actual API.




Mock functions in Jest are used to simulate the behavior of real functions, allowing you to test code in isolation. They are particularly useful when you want to:

Test components or functions that depend on complex logic or external resources (e.g., APIs, databases) without actually calling those resources.
Ensure that certain functions are called with specific arguments or a specific number of times.
Replace real implementations of functions during tests to control the output and test edge cases.
Example: Basic Jest Mock Function
Let's start with a simple example.

1. Code Example
Suppose you have a module that fetches user data from an API:

userService.js:
async function fetchUser(userId) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`);
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}
module.exports = { fetchUser };


And you have another module that relies on fetchUser to log the user's name:

logger.js:
const userService = require('./userService');

async function logUserName(userId) {
  const user = await userService.fetchUser(userId);
  console.log(user.name);
}

module.exports = { logUserName };


2. Test with Jest Mock Function
You can mock the fetchUser function to avoid making real API calls and to control its behavior during tests:

logger.test.js:

const userService = require('./userService');
const logger = require('./logger');

// Mock the fetchUser function
jest.mock('./userService');

test('logUserName logs the correct user name', async () => {
  // Arrange
  const mockUser = { id: 1, name: 'Alice' };
  userService.fetchUser.mockResolvedValue(mockUser);

  // Act
  await logger.logUserName(1);

  // Assert
  expect(userService.fetchUser).toHaveBeenCalledWith(1);
  expect(userService.fetchUser).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
});
3. Explanation
jest.mock('./userService'): This tells Jest to automatically mock all functions in the userService module.
mockResolvedValue: This is used to set the return value of the fetchUser mock function when it’s called. In this case, it returns a resolved Promise with a mockUser object.
Assertions:
expect(userService.fetchUser).toHaveBeenCalledWith(1): Ensures that fetchUser was called with the correct userId.
expect(userService.fetchUser).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1): Ensures that fetchUser was called exactly once.
Real-Time Use Cases for Jest Mock Functions
Testing Network Requests:

Suppose you have a function that makes an HTTP request to an external service. Instead of making real HTTP requests in your tests (which can be slow and unreliable), you can use a mock function to simulate the request and control its response. This allows you to test how your function handles various response scenarios (e.g., success, error, timeout).
Isolating Components in Unit Tests:

In a large application, components often rely on other components or services. By mocking these dependencies, you can test each component in isolation. For example, you might mock a database service when testing a function that processes user data, ensuring the test focuses only on the processing logic and not on the database interactions.
Simulating Edge Cases:

Mock functions allow you to simulate rare or difficult-to-reproduce scenarios. For instance, you can mock a function to throw an error or return a specific value that triggers an edge case in your code. This helps ensure your code handles all possible scenarios, even those that are unlikely to occur in normal operation.
Performance Optimization:

When testing performance-sensitive code, you can use mock functions to replace expensive operations (e.g., complex calculations, I/O operations) with simpler, faster ones. This allows you to measure the performance of the code under test without being affected by the performance of its dependencies.
Testing Event Handlers:

In frontend applications, you can use mock functions to test event handlers. For example, you can mock a function that’s supposed to be called when a user clicks a button and verify that it’s called with the correct arguments.
Advanced Mocking: Mock Implementation
Sometimes you may want to provide a custom implementation for a mock function. Here’s how you can do that:

userService.fetchUser.mockImplementation(async (userId) => {
  if (userId === 1) {
    return { id: 1, name: 'Mocked Alice' };
  } else {
    return { id: userId, name: 'Mocked User' };
  }
});
This allows you to provide different behavior for the mock function based on the input arguments.

Conclusion
Mock functions in Jest are a powerful tool for testing code in isolation, simulating external dependencies, and ensuring your code handles all scenarios correctly. By using mocks, you can focus on testing the logic of the code under test without being influenced by the behavior of its dependencies.
